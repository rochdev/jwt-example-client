# jwt-example-client

## Setup for development

Make sure you have `npm` and `bower` globally available, then run:

```sh
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ gulp
```

You need to have the server running for this project to work properly. You can grab the server at [rochdev/jwt-example-server](https://github.com/rochdev/jwt-example-client/edit/master/README.md)
